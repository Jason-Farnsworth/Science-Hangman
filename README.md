# Science Hangman
Science Hangman is a project that I made for my local Society of Physics Students chapter. I created it to be an engaging way to discuss science and physics in a more social and fun way.

To play Science Hangman, download the HTML file. Open a new tab, and drag the HTML file from File Explorer into the new tab. The page should then display in your browser. 
There isn't keyboard functionality - it may be a feature I add in the future. 

Disclaimer: I had made the original game in Pygame, but then had it converted to HTML using AI.
